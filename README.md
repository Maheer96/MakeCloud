AI Assistant for provisioning infrastructure on ANY cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...) in a simple and easy way

(try "aws s3" or "aws ec2" in site to get started)

Also:
  Run backend with "python app.py"
  Add in a gemini api key
  Run front end with "npm run dev" and maybe use "npm i" first if needed
